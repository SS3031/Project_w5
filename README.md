Summary of the dataset:
## Vanguard performed a digital experiment aimed at enhancing the user experience (UX) of their online platform by implementing a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI) along with timely in-context prompts. The experiment's primary goal was to determine whether these changes would positively impact client engagement and encourage more clients to complete processes on the platform. Now, I have to analyse and conclude the resulting dataset obtained from the experiment.
